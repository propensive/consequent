// What `flair assess` records, as BinTEL in git notes under `refs/notes/flair-assess/<rule>`:
//
//  - a JUDGEMENT on the blob of each definition's normalised text (the blob's hash is the
//    definition's digest, so the target exists the moment the digest is computed): the model's
//    answers for that definition, valid while the rule, rubric, criteria and model match;
//  - an ASSESSMENT on the input tree: every candidate's locus, the digest it had, its score and
//    band — the ranking — with the run's totals;
//  - a text-TEL POINTER appended to the HEAD commit's note, as `flair metrics` writes one.
//
// A definition's judgement therefore survives every edit around it: a line shift, a rename, a
// move to another file or a reformat keeps the digest, and only a change to its own text — or
// to the rubric, criteria or model — asks the model again. The tree notes map each locus to the
// digest it had, so a locus can be followed across commits and a changed verdict attributed
// either to the code (the digest changed) or to the rubric (its digest did).
//
// This module is compiled WITHOUT capture checking, as Pyrocosm's `remote` is: stratiform's
// derived TEL codecs expand to instances the capture checker sees as fresh capabilities where a
// pure instance is required, so their derivation sites must sit in an unchecked module. The
// client reads and writes the records through `encode` and `decode` alone.
